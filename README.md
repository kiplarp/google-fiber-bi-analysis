# Google Fiber Customer Service BI Dashboard Project

## Workplace Scenario Overview

As part of a data analytics assessment, I completed a business intelligence project for the fictional Google Fiber customer call center. This simulated scenario required using BI methodology (capture, analyze, monitor) to design dashboards that address key customer service issues using anonymized, semi-realistic data.

## Project Background

- **Goal:** Explore and visualize trends in repeat customer calls to the support line, aiming to help Fiber leadership understand first-contact resolution rates and drivers of repeat contact.
- **Focus Questions:**
  - How often do customers call again after their initial inquiry?
  - What types of problems generate the most repeat calls?
  - Which market city receives the highest volume of repeat calls?

## Dataset Details

- **Data Includes:**
  - Number of calls per customer
  - Number of repeat calls after first contact
  - Call type (see problem categories below)
  - Market city (three anonymized city columns: `market_1`, `market_2`, `market_3`)
  - Date of contact and repeat call timing (`contacts_n`, `contacts_n_#days`)
- **Problem Type Categories:**
  - **Type 1:** Account Management
  - **Type 2:** Technician Troubleshooting
  - **Type 3:** Scheduling
  - **Type 4:** Construction
  - **Type 5:** Internet & Wi-Fi

## Stakeholders & Team

- **Primary Stakeholders:** Emma Santiago (Hiring Manager), Keith Portone (Project Manager), Minna Rah (Lead BI Analyst)
- **BI Team Members:** Ian Ortega, Sylvie Essa
- **Accessibility:** Dashboard formatted for large print and text-to-speech compatibility.

## Project Requirements

- Reveal insights about repeat caller volume and causes
- Enable breakdowns by city, problem type, and time period (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- Provide accessible visualizations (charts and tables)
- Ensure all stakeholders have access to underlying anonymized data for review

## Deliverables

- **Charts/Tables:**
  - Repeat calls by first-contact date
  - Repeat calls by market and problem type
  - Time-based breakdowns (week, month, quarter, year)
- **Success Criteria:**
  - Demonstrate operational insights that can reduce overall call volume, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize customer service operations

## Open Questions (for next phase/stakeholder review)

1. What additional breakdowns or segmentations do stakeholders find most valuable beyond city and problem type?
2. Are there specific accessibility features (besides large print/text-to-speech) that should be prioritized for dashboard design?
3. How should privacy compliance and data governance be handled for ongoing dashboard access/review?
