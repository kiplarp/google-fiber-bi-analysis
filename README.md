# Google Fiber Business Intelligence Analysis

## Project Overview
Business intelligence analysis project examining Google Fiber customer support repeat caller scenarios, focusing on data-driven insights to improve customer service efficiency and reduce call volume through predictive analytics and performance dashboards.

## Problem Statement
Google Fiber customer support faces challenges with repeat callers - customers who contact support multiple times about the same issue. This project aims to identify patterns, root causes, and actionable insights to improve customer satisfaction while reducing operational costs.

## Project Objectives
- **Primary**: Reduce repeat caller volume by 15% within 6 months
- **Secondary**: Improve first-call resolution rate by 10%
- **Tertiary**: Develop predictive models to identify at-risk customers

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Repeat Caller Rate (%)
- First Call Resolution Rate (%)
- Average Time to Resolution (hours)
- Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)
- Support Agent Efficiency Metrics
- Cost per Support Interaction

## Data Sources
- Customer support call logs
- Customer service tickets (CRM system)
- Network performance data
- Customer demographic information
- Service installation records
- Billing and payment history
